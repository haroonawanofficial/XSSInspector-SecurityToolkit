## Features

- **URL Processor**: XSS Inspector can perform data cleansing and url check for .asp, .php, .cgi and more....
```
# Supported extensions and common endpoints
    supported_extensions = [".php", ".asp", ".htm", ".html", ".aspx", ".jsp", ".cgi"]
    common_endpoints = [
        "search?q=", "q?=", "id?=", "filter?q=", "query?=",
        "name?=", "key?=", "page?=", "action?q=", "term?q=",
        "login?", "signup?", "view?id=", "browse?q="
    ]
    scheme_regex = re.compile(r"^https?://")
    embedded_url_regex = re.compile(r'"url":\s*"([^"]+)"')
```

- **Heuristic-Based Logic**: XSS Inspector can determine if an endpoint exists using heuristics. By leveraging assumptions and advanced reasoning, it verifies the endpoint and attempts to inject payloads to assess whether the remote target is vulnerable.

- **URL Crawling**: XSS Inspector supports various methods of collecting URLs, including Common Crawl, Wayback Machine, and OTX Alienvault.

- **Multi-Threading**: Utilize the power of multi-threading to scan a large number of URLs quickly.

- **Payload Testing**: The tool includes a variety of XSS payloads to test web applications for vulnerabilities.

- **Subdomain Discovery**: The tool collects and includes the results of subdomains in the final list of URLs as not only the URLs associated with the target domain but also its subdomains.

- **Multi Processing**: Built-in python's multiprocessing advantage, which is better suited for CPU-bound tasks like scanning multiple URLs for vulnerabilities.
  
- **Multi Threading**: Built-in python's advantage to use default threads 50 but it goes upto 100 if CPU supports that much suited for tasks like scanning multiple URLs for vulnerabilities.

- **URL Record Tracker**: Keep tracking if we are same link with payloads or obfuscation or not; provides solid information.
  
- **SQLite**: Sqllite is a self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration database engine that is used in embedded systems, mobile devices, desktop applications, and small-scale database applications.

- **SQLite Database File (xss_vulnerabilities.db) for XSSInspector**:


1. xss_vulnerabilities.db is an SQLite database used to store information about detected XSS vulnerabilities during the scanning process.
2. Structured Storage: The database provides structured storage for vulnerabilities and their associated URLs.
3. Persistence: Data stored in the database persists across multiple runs of the scanning tool, allowing for historical tracking of security findings.
4. Ease of Querying: SQLite supports SQL queries, making it easy to retrieve and analyze stored data.
5. Security Findings: Vulnerable URLs and related details are stored in the database, including the URL itself and other relevant information.
6. Centralized Storage: All security findings are kept in one centralized location, facilitating efficient vulnerability management.
7. Historical Data: The database accumulates historical data on detected vulnerabilities, enabling trend analysis and reporting over time.
8. Reporting and Compliance: Structured data in the database aids in generating comprehensive reports and compliance documentation.

  
- **Final Report**: The tool generates detailed HTML reports with identified vulnerabilities, making it easier to address security concerns.

## False Positive Reducation

1. In an effort to reduce false positives when hunting for XSS vulnerabilities, this tool employs a False Positive Damping approach.
2. It automatically sends a HEAD request to the URL and checks the `Content-Type` header of the response. 
3. The tool examines `Content-Type` header indicates that the URL points to a non-HTML or non-PHP file (e.g., images, non-web content), the tool bypasses the URL link.
4. Parameter Analysis: For each URL, it analysis the query parameters to identify parameters that may be related to file handling. This includes parameters such as "file," "path," "image," "download," etc.
5. Parameter Whitelisting: It creats whitelist parameters that are known to be safe and not associated with file handling. 
6. Filtering: Before testing a payload against a URL, it checks if any of the query parameters match the file-related keywords. 

   
## Heuristic & Obfuscation Structure and Logic:
- Enhanced Detection Accuracy: The heuristic logic fine-tunes the scanner to detect XSS vulnerabilities more accurately by concentrating on common attack patterns.
- Reduced False Positives: The heuristic logic helps minimize false positives by identifying potential vulnerabilities based on known attack indicators.
- Evasion and Bypass Capabilities: Obfuscation logic strengthens the scanner's evasion techniques, making it harder for security mechanisms to thwart attacks.
- Comprehensive Testing: With obfuscation techniques, the scanner thoroughly tests potential vulnerabilities by employing multiple payload variations.
- Improved Reliability: The combination of heuristic and obfuscation logic ensures a more reliable and effective XSS scanner, resulting in precise vulnerability identification and decreased security risks.
